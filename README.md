# Complete C# Programming Master Class – Assignments

This repository contains my personal solutions to the assignments from the  
**Complete C# Programming Master Class** course on Udemy.

## Structure

Each assignment is located in its own folder:
/AssignmentPart3
/AssignmentPart4

As I progress through the course, new assignment folders will be added and committed to this repository.

## Notes

- All code is written in C# using Visual Studio.
- Solutions focus on clarity, correctness, and applying the concepts taught in the course.
- This repository serves both as a personal learning archive and as a demonstration of my hands-on experience in C#.
